Pitch

As Open Source Smell Culture co-founder Saskia Brown-Wilson put it, ““[w]hat you might refer to as ‘sampling culture’ in music, for example, doesn’t exist in the world of scent. I know a lot of people who got in trouble this way. I think that sampling is important and necessary because it allows people to build on each other’s creativity. It allows us to learn from each other.” The CAT Lab concurs, and we’re here to teach you fragrance fundamentals so you can create our recipes and craft your own.

Preparation

For safety and supplies, Art and Olfaction’s fantastic open source perfume primer, https://artandolfaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IAO_1_PRIMER_V4.pdf, is an absolute must.

Pure materials, such as those that comprise Search Engine, can be diluted in solvents for efficiency, economics, and ease: it’s cheap and simple to work with resulting dilutions. The CAT Lab’s preferred solvent is DPG, also known as perfumer’s alcohol. Purchase Art and Olfaction’s recommended supplies, along with DPG and the materials identified below, before getting started.

Process

Reviewing Primer. Take another look at Art and Olfaction’s perfume primer, particularly the parts about safety.

Diluting Materials. Using clean pipettes, dilute each of your materials to a ratio of 10% material to 90% DPG. (Ten drops of material to ninety drops of DPG does the trick.) Confirm the composition of each material before diluting, as some are already diluted.

Combining Materials. Line up the 10% dilutions you need for World Wide Web. Using each vial’s dropper or a clean pipette, combine the dilutions to create an accord. (The recipe can be scaled up to create bigger batches.) Play with the proportions of World Wide Web to discover what suits your preferences and body chemistry.

Learning More. If you’re even more curious about the perfumemaking process, consider taking an Atlas Obscura class with Saskia Wilson-Brown herself, https://www.atlasobscura.com/experiences/perfume-online-course. (That’s how I got started!)

Perfume

Search Engine is inspired by the groundbreaking of Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble. It smells like a ritualistic cleansing of the ghosts that shape Google searches—specifically the racist, sexist ones. Like search engines, black pepper is so pervasive that people often forget to think about it. The woody palo santo is associated with purification. And the lingering haze of smoke is a reminder that companies are blowing smoke up your ass when they say their technologies are netural.

Sample Search Engine to imagine the results you’d like to see.
